            Any information you submitted to the website is used solely for internal <strong>NextGen Bike Rentals</strong> purposes in connection with the admin of the website. <strong>NextGen Bike Rentals</strong> will not divulge any of the personal information to any third party unless otherwise expressly permitted by these Terms of Use, the Privacy Statement, or as further authorized by you. <strong>NextGen Bike Rentals</strong>, however, cannot ensure that any of your private transmissions will be secure from unauthorized or unlawful access by third parties. <strong>NextGen Bike Rentals</strong> reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to edit, refuse to post, or remove any information or materials, in whole or in part.

        <p>
            This Terms of Use shall be governed to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
